This series comprises of the most basic concepts of DS done fully using libraries. It is supposed to be a stepping stone into more complex projects to be picked up later. 
Brief description of projects as follows,

Project 10 - Linear regression implementation using SciKit-Learn.
Project 11 - Linear regression RMSE and R2 calculation with test-train-split.
