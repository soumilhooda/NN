# Word Cloud
Just a fun wordcloud made for someone.

# Dependencies

The PDFs were first converted top text files using [pdfminer](https://pypi.org/project/pdfminer/).
These text files were then concatenated and passed into [word__cloud](http://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/).

In another model I had made which gave ridiculously blurry images, I had also used [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/) and [pyenchant](https://pypi.org/project/pyenchant/) for some preprocessing. The same may be used here.

# Future Work

Remove the blurry-ness that exists. Probably has something to do with the interpolation

# Side Project

I also made one wordcloud for SEDS BPHC. An organisation I work for and it turned out half-decent only.
